                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                    It all started with a simple idea: to create high-quality,
                    beautifully designed clothing that stands the test of time.
                    Frustrated with the endless cycle of fast fashion, we set
                    out to build a brand that values craftsmanship,
                    sustainability, and a genuine connection with its community.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                    YourBrand was born from a passion for pieces that tell a
                    story. Each item in our collection is thoughtfully designed
                    and ethically crafted, meant to be a cherished part of your
                    wardrobe for years to come.
